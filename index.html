        Hello Touqa,<br><br>
        I hope I spelt your name right as it's unique, firstly I wanna apologise if I made you uncomfortable or uneasy on Wednesday, that wasn't my intention.
        I'm very awkward with people I don't know and I felt like I did make you feel uncomfortable and I hope you can forgive me, I should've first let you know how I am with people I barely know,
        although with people I know I'm very easy-going. I'd also like to get to know you, we both don't know each other, although I made a horrible first impression I do hope this changes your perspective on me
        I do'nt think we should just base it off the first time and I believe one time isn't enough as I spent endless months building up the confidience to ask for your snap and and all that shouldn't juust go off one time/<br><br>

        When you are talking to someone I think you should take at least a few months getting to know the person for who they are because then you really know a person and don't fall in love with the potential of a person instead of staying stagnent and feeling empty at the end.
        I do hope I can make another impression that was better than last time although I will be honest it'll take a while but I'm willing to take the time.
        It was a pleasure being with you although I was awkward and my mind was racing on what to say ngl but I do wish for it again and if you do too then I'd love to get a frappe from Starbucks as I'm used to that setting as I'm usually in there.
        And when I say I wanna get to knkw you, I don't just mean like being around you but the generic things too such as your favourite coffee, favourite meal, favourite flowers that typ e of stuff (not in a corny way)<br><br>

        Anyways, I'll tell you few things about me, my favourite song is Bags by Clairo which reminds me of you, favourite artists are Clairo, Laufey and Faye Webster
        I LOVE CATS, LIKE A LOT, WHENEVER I SEE CATS I PLAY W THEM. I always get Matcha latte or Caramnel Frappe.<br><br>

        I wasn't gonna write any of this but i RABNDOMLY WOKE up last nuight before my Fajr alarm like 35 mins early so I prayed Tahajjud and thought and Istikhara and thought if it's meant to be and it works then it does but I mentioned you in Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha even though idk you but thought why not even though thtas kinda weird
        and I know I can't change the first impression but I do hopoe I can change how we see one another and I still have hope personally and won't give up simply when it took months to build up the courage yk and every tuesday seeing if you were in when i came in and it can be talked out.<br><br>

        If not though, as I understand I was blocked, I unserstand there is nothing wrong with that chouice as at the end of the day it is your choice and my choice too, but if not please let me know instead of just not saying anything and persobnally if not, I'm not the type to beg for attention or time so I'll leave it.
        Also this website took so long to code, the code kept breaking and i got errors so many times and its still broken but it is what it is, and if you cant tell I take computer science and I just realised you dk my ethnicity but thats irrelvant and im getting off topic and typing too much for you to read, anyways Byeee, but let me know by messaging me on:<br><br>
